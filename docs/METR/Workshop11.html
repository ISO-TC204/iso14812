	<h1>Questions for METR Workshop 11: METR Deployment Part I</h1>
	<p>The eleventh METR workshop will include focus on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What prerequisites should be met for METR participation?</li>
		<li>What events might trigger the revocation of authorization to serve as a METR-affiliated regulator, collector, disseminator, or user (e.g., field reporter)?</li>
		<li>Should we define standardized conformance or maturity capabilities for METR-systems?</li>
		<li>What features of METR need to be implemented by a system to claim basic METR conformance?</li>
		<li>Is there a need to indicate the multiple regulators that might exist within a single jurisdictional entity?</li>
		<li>How should user systems (e.g., ADS-equipped vehicles, driver assistance systems) respond in the absence of real-time METR data for the userâ€™s current location?</li>
		<li>What complications arise if only a subset of vehicles have real-time data?</li>
		<li>Is there a greater need for METR availability in areas that support dynamic regulations?</li>
		<li>To what extent and for what purpose(s) is there a need to track the performance of each METR component?</li>
		<li>To what extent and for what purpose(s) is there a need to monitor the accuracy of the electronic regulations?</li>
		<li>To what extent is there a need to support non-repudiation (e.g., to support auditing, insurance claims)?</li>
		<li>What management and control features does METR need to support?</li>
		<li>Who might be responsible for maintaining the operation of the METR subsystems?</li>
		<li>How is each entity funded?</li>
	</ul>
