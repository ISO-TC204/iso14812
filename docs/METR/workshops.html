<p>ISO/TC 204/WG 19  is developing standards  that facilitate the delivery of trustworthy, machine interpretable rules of the road as authorized by respective jurisdictions. These standards will allow jurisdictions to better inform transportation system users of current official information (e.g., speed limits) and thus further promote a safe and effective transport system that:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides authoritative information to driver assist systems (e.g., so that they can present trustworthy in-vehicle signage);</li>
<li>enables driving automation systems (e.g., road vehicles, sidewalk delivery robots) to have information related to the driving task that is sufficiently trustworthy for safety-related uses as well as for enforcement; and</li>
<li>conveys authoritative information to pedestrians, micromobility, and other transport users.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 250px;">As illustrated below, these standards will include the provision of both static (stable) information (e.g., as contained in the vehicle code, posted on permanent signs, or marked on roadways) and dynamic information (e.g., variable speed limits). The scope of this standards effort focuses on the pipeline that will deliver rules of the road; cover virtually all modes of surface transport; and create and develop standards for information accuracy, reliability, timeliness, authentication, and traceability back to the authorizing agency. To the extent possible, the standard will be compatible with existing data definitions.</p>

<p>To better ensure that these standards address both todayâ€™s and tomorrowâ€™s needs, ISO/TC 204/WG 19 is reaching out to surface transport professionals and advocates to better understand stakeholder needs that should be incorporated. Specifically, ISO/TC 204/WG 19 is interested in hearing from stakeholders from the following perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport users, including vulnerable road users, micromobility users, and automobile operators</li>
<li>Transport infrastructure operations, including traffic engineers, toll road operators, and parking facility operators</li>
<li>Maintenance and construction personnel</li>
<li>Transport service operators, including public transport agencies, delivery companies, and ridesourcing companies</li>
<li>Transport entity owners, including municipalities, campus owners, and fleet managers</li>
<li>Enforcement personnel, including law enforcement, lawyers, and insurance companies</li>
<li>Manufacturers, including those for automated driving systems, driver assistive technologies, and delivery drones</li>
<li>Technology specialists, including automated vehicle experts, location perception experts, and video image processing experts</li>
<li>Information support entities, including map providers, navigation providers, and traveller information providers</li>
<li>Advocates, including safety, environmental, equity, and disability rights advocates</li>
</ul>
<p>To facilitate input from these various groups, ISO/TC 204/WG 19 has scheduled the following public workshops for the indicated topics: </p>
