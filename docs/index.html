		<p style="font-size: large;">This website will display the "Approved" version of the ISO 14812 Concept Model for ITS Vocabulary. At present, there is a proposed version of the initial draft, which can be found at <a href="https://k-vaughn.github.io/iso14812/">https://k-vaughn.github.io/iso14812/</a>. As of February 2019, our best guess is that the first version of ISO 14812 will be approved sometime around April 2020.</p>
