# ISO 14812 _Intelligent Transport Systems - Vocabulary_
This repository is provided to promote the collaborative development of terminology for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community. The work is led by ISO/TC 204/WG 1, but we are interested in receiving input from the full ITS community so that the end result is a resource that will be widely used and accepted.

The process used by this effort conforms to ISO 704:2009, which defines the following process for each concept (i.e., meaning of a term) that you wish to define:

1. Analyse the intension (i.e., characteristics) and extension (i.e., resulting set of objects) of the concept
2. Determine the concept's relationships to other concepts
3. Illustrate the relationships with a concept diagram
4. Formulate definitions based on the relationships
5. Assign a designation (i.e., the term) to each concept in the diagram

The process used by this effort also conforms to ISO 24156-1:2014, which defines how to use UML to illustrate relationships with a concept diagram (Step 3 above). The UML diagrams are created and maintained using [Sparx Enterprise Architect](https://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea/index.html) and version controlled in both native *.eap files and XMI (in *.xml) files so that they can be imported into any number of different tools.

The material found on this site is copyrighted by ISO, but is freely distributed as all ISO Vocabulary documents can be shared for free. The master directory on this site reflects approved ISO material. The development branch contains the most recent draft being discussed within the WG. 

As of February 2019, this document is a work in progress. Current expectations is that the document will be reviewed within ISO TC 204 during the summer of 2019 and sent to a draft technical report ballot in October 2019 with a potentially approved version in roughly April 2020.

The model can be viewed a few different ways. For an interactive website of the information, you can go to:

1. View the [website](https://ISO-TC204.github.io/iso14812/) of the approved terms (from the master branch which is currently empty), or
2. View the [website](https://k-vaughn.github.io/iso14812/) of all terms currently being discussed as being a part of the next version of the Vocabulary document (due to anomalies with the tools, this is on WG1's convenor's personal GitHub site).

In addition, you can download the information in a number of formats from either the master branch (for approved items) or the development branch (for items under discussion). The formats included are:

1. 14812.pdf for a copy of the information in standard ISO documentation format
2. 14812.eap for the original Enterprise Architect 14 format
3. 14812.xml for the UML file in the open XMI 2.1 format
