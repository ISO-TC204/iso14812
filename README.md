# ISO 14812 _Intelligent Transport Systems - Vocabulary_
This repository is provided to promote the collaborative development of terminology for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community. The work is led by ISO/TC 204/WG 1, but we are interested in receiving input from the full ITS community so that the end result is a resource that will be widely used and accepted.

The model can be viewed a few different ways from this website. Approved versions are stored in the "master" branch while the lastest drafts are stored in the "development" branch. 

|Format | Description       |Master Link | Development Link|
|-------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
|EAP    |The complete UML model stored in Enterprise Architect 14 file format| N/A |[14812.eap](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812/blob/development/14812.eap)
|HTML   |An HTML site that allows the user to interact with the UML model and see all meta-data using any web browser|N/A| [website](https://ISO-TC204.github.io/iso14812/development/)
|Wiki|The Wiki tab of this Github site includes pages that list the terms and definitions that each working group is most likely to be interested in|N/A|[Wiki](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812/wiki)
|XMI    |The UML model exported to XMI 2.1 format, which can be imported into most UML modelling tools|N/A|[14812.xml](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812/blob/development/14812.xml)
|XML    |A generic listing of every term in XML, which can be useful for identifying changes between versions by performing a diff using a simple text diff tool|N/A|[full_listing.xml](https://github.com/ISO-TC204/iso14812/blob/development/full_listing.xml)

As of March 2019, the first approved version of ISO 14812 is expected in Spring 2020; therefore the master branch is largely empty for now.

The process used by this effort conforms to ISO 704:2009, which defines the following process for each concept (i.e., meaning of a term) that you wish to define:

1. Analyse the intension (i.e., characteristics) and extension (i.e., resulting set of objects) of the concept
2. Determine the concept's relationships to other concepts
3. Illustrate the relationships with a concept diagram
4. Formulate definitions based on the relationships
5. Assign a designation (i.e., the term) to each concept in the diagram

The process used by this effort also conforms to ISO 24156-1:2014, which defines how to use UML to illustrate relationships with a concept diagram (Step 3 above). 

The material found on this site is copyrighted by ISO, but is freely distributed as all ISO Vocabulary documents can be shared for free. The master branch on this site reflects approved ISO material. The development branch contains the most recent draft being discussed within the WG.
