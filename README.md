# ISO 14812 _Intelligent Transport Systems - Vocabulary_
This repository is provided to promote the collaborative development of terminology for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community. The work is led by ISO/TC 204/WG 1, but we are interested in receiving input from the full ITS community so that the end result is a resource that will be widely used and accepted.

Details about how to view the model and how to contribute can be found on the [Wiki](wiki) site.
